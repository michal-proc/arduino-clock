# Arduino Clock Project

This project implements a simple digital clock using Arduino. The clock can display the current time and potentially offer additional features depending on the configuration.

## Features

- Displays the current time.
- Supports integration with various modules such as an RTC (Real-Time Clock) module.
- Easy-to-read digital display.
- Customizable and extendable functionality.

## Components

To build this project, you will need the following components:

- Arduino (e.g., Arduino Uno)
- RTC module (e.g., DS3231 or DS1307)
- 7-segment display or LCD (optional)
- Jumper wires
- Breadboard

## Circuit Diagram

Connect the components following the instructions in the code comments or based on the hardware configuration you choose (e.g., using an RTC module and a display).

## Usage

Once the code is uploaded to the Arduino, the clock should begin displaying the time. If you are using an RTC module, ensure it is properly connected to maintain accurate timekeeping.

## Customization

You can extend this project by adding new features, such as:

- Alarm functionality.
- Temperature display (if you connect a sensor).
- Different display modes (12-hour or 24-hour formats).
- Power-saving modes.
